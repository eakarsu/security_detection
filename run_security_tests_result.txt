After running `run_security_tests.py`, here's exactly what you should expect to see in each page of the NodeGuard dashboard:

## 🎯 What the Security Test Script Does

The `run_security_tests.py` script sends __13 different security test events__ to Kafka, which are then processed by the ML engine and create incidents based on risk scores:

### Test Events Generated:

1. __CRITICAL Threats (Risk 9.0+)__:

   - SQL Injection Attack (Risk: 9.2)
   - Ransomware Activity (Risk: 9.8)
   - APT Command & Control (Risk: 9.5)
   - Zero-Day Exploit (Risk: 9.9)

2. __HIGH Threats (Risk 7.0-8.9)__:

   - Lateral Movement (Risk: 8.7)
   - Data Exfiltration (Risk: 9.1)
   - Privilege Escalation (Risk: 8.9)

3. __MEDIUM Threats (Risk 5.0-6.9)__:

   - Brute Force Attack (Risk: 6.5)
   - Port Scanning (Risk: 5.8)
   - DNS Tunneling (Risk: 6.2)

4. __LOW/BENIGN Events (Risk <5.0)__:

   - Normal Web Traffic (Risk: 1.2)
   - System Update (Risk: 0.5)
   - Admin Activity (Risk: 2.1)

## 📊 Dashboard Page - What You'll See:

__Real-time Security Metrics:__

- Related events and correlations
- Timeline of attack progression
- Affected systems and users

## 🔍 Threat Intelligence Page - What You'll See:

__New Threat Indicators:__

- __Malicious IPs__: External IPs from the test events
- __Suspicious Domains__: legitimate-looking-domain.com (C2 domain)
- __File Hashes__: encrypt.exe and other malicious binaries
- __Attack Patterns__: SQL injection signatures, ransomware behaviors
- __IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)__: Bitcoin addresses, file paths, registry keys

__Threat Intelligence Feeds:__

- Updated threat scores for detected IPs
- New malware signatures from ransomware test
- APT29/CozyBear campaign indicators
- Zero-day exploit patterns

__Expected Intelligence Updates:__

## 📋 Compliance Reports Page - What You'll See:

__Policy Violations Detected:__

- __Data Protection Violations__: From data exfiltration event
- __Access Control Failures__: From privilege escalation attempts
- __Network Security Breaches__: From lateral movement
- __Incident Response Triggers__: All critical/high severity events

__Compliance Metrics:__

- __Security Posture Score__: Decreased due to critical incidents
- __Policy Adherence__: Violations in access control, data protection
- __Incident Response Time__: Time to detect and classify threats
- __Risk Assessment__: Updated risk profile based on new threats

## 🔄 Expected System Behavior:

__Immediate (0-30 seconds):__

- Events appear in real-time dashboard feed
- ML engine processes and scores each event
- Critical/High events trigger incident creation

__Short-term (1-5 minutes):__

- Incidents populated with full details
- Threat intelligence updated with new IOCs
- Compliance reports reflect new violations
- Automated workflows may trigger (if configured)

__Ongoing:__

- Correlation engine links related events
- Risk scores updated based on threat patterns
- Historical trending data updated
- Alert notifications sent (if configured)

## 🎯 Key Success Indicators:

✅ __Dashboard shows 13 new events processed__ ✅ __7 new security incidents created (Critical + High risk)__ ✅ __Threat intelligence updated with new IOCs__ ✅ __Compliance violations logged and tracked__ ✅ __ML confidence scores displayed (0.87-0.99)__ ✅ __Real-time event processing working__ ✅ __No errors in system logs__

The system should demonstrate end-to-end threat detection, from raw security events through ML analysis to actionable security incidents and intelligence updates.
