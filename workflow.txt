How Workflows Work in NodeGuard

  Based on my analysis, here's how the workflow system operates in your NodeGuard security
  platform:

  🎯 Core Purpose

  Workflows automate complex security detection and response operations through visual
  drag-and-drop pipelines. Think of it as "security automation made visual" - you build security
  processes like connecting building blocks.

  🔧 How It Works

  1. Visual Workflow Builder

  - Drag & Drop Interface: Use React Flow to visually connect security nodes
  - Node Palette: Choose from 6 specialized security node types:
    - Input: Data ingestion (Kafka, logs, events)
    - ML Scoring: Classical ML analysis (XGBoost, Random Forest)
    - AI Analysis: Advanced AI using Claude Sonnet 4
    - Correlation: Event correlation across time/systems
    - Alert: Multi-channel alert generation
    - Response: Automated security actions

  2. Workflow Creation Process

  1. Select Node → 2. Configure Parameters → 3. Connect Nodes → 4. Save Workflow → 5. Execute

  3. Real-World Example Workflows

  Basic Threat Detection Pipeline:
  Network Logs → ML Scoring → AI Analysis → Alert Generation → Response Actions

  Compliance Monitoring:
  Audit Events → Policy Validation → Correlation Analysis → Compliance Alert

  Incident Response:
  Security Event → Threat Assessment → Risk Scoring → Auto-Response → Notification

  🏗️ System Architecture

  Frontend (React)

  - Visual workflow designer with React Flow
  - Real-time node status indicators
  - Interactive configuration dialogs
  - Workflow templates and presets

  Backend (Node.js)

  - RESTful API for workflow management
  - Workflow execution engine
  - Integration with Python ML services
  - Connection to Kafka for real-time data

  Key Integration Points

  - Python ML Models: Your existing XGBoost/Random Forest models
  - OpenRouter AI: Claude Sonnet 4 for advanced analysis
  - Kafka Streams: Real-time security event processing
  - Alert Systems: Email, Slack, SMS notifications

  💡 Practical Benefits

  1. No-Code Security Automation: Build complex security processes visually
  2. AI-Powered Analysis: Combine classical ML with modern LLM capabilities
  3. Real-Time Processing: Connect to your existing Kafka event streams
  4. Flexible Response: Automated actions with approval workflows
  5. Template Library: Pre-built workflows for common security scenarios

  🚀 Current Status

  - ✅ Visual builder fully functional
  - ✅ All node types implemented
  - ✅ Template system ready
  - ✅ API endpoints active
  - 🔄 Execution engine currently simulated (ready for production integration)

  The workflow system is designed to transform your security operations from manual, reactive
  processes into automated, proactive security pipelines. You can build anything from simple threat
   detection to complex multi-stage incident response workflows!
