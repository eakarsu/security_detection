‚è∫ üéØ Strategic Implementation Plan

  Looking at your current system working beautifully (I can see the workflow execution logs!),
  let's build on this foundation strategically:

  Phase 1 (Next 3 months) - Core Platform Enhancement

  1. Node Plugin Architecture
  // Let's start with this - it's the foundation for everything else
  interface SecurityNode {
    id: string;
    type: string;
    category: 'soar' | 'cloud' | 'ai-ml' | 'integration';
    execute(input: SecurityEvent): Promise<SecurityResult>;
    configure(params: NodeParams): ValidationResult;
    getSchema(): NodeSchema;
  }

  2. Enhanced Node Library (10 new nodes)
  - MITRE ATT&CK Node: Automatic tactic/technique identification
  - Threat Intel Enrichment: IOC lookup and enrichment
  - User Behavior Analytics: Anomaly detection
  - Cloud Security Scanner: AWS/Azure/GCP security checks
  - YARA Scanner: Malware detection
  - Splunk Connector: Search and alert integration
  - ServiceNow Incident: Automatic ticket creation
  - Slack Notification: Team communication
  - Forensics Collector: Evidence gathering
  - Compliance Checker: Policy validation

  3. Workflow Templates Library
  - Incident Response Playbook
  - Malware Analysis Workflow
  - Phishing Investigation
  - Data Breach Response
  - Compliance Audit

  Quick Win: Let's Start with Node Plugin Architecture
