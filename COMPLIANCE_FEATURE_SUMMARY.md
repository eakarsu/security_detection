- **React Hooks**: State management with useState and useEffect
- **API Integration**: RESTful API calls to backend services

### Key Interfaces
```typescript
interface ComplianceReport {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  framework: string;
  status: 'draft' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  compliance_score: number;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
  generated_by: string;
  period_start: string;
  period_end: string;
  total_controls: number;
  passed_controls: number;
  failed_controls: number;
  findings: ComplianceFinding[];
}

interface ComplianceFinding {
  id: string;
  control_id: string;
  control_name: string;
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  status: 'pass' | 'fail' | 'not_applicable';
  description: string;
  evidence: string;
  remediation: string;
}

interface ComplianceFramework {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  version: string;
  total_controls: number;
  categories: string[];
}
```

### API Endpoints Expected
- `GET /api/compliance` - Fetch compliance data (reports and frameworks)
- `POST /api/compliance/reports` - Create new compliance report
- `GET /api/compliance/reports/{id}/download` - Download report as PDF

## UI/UX Features

### Dashboard Statistics
- Total Reports count
- Completed Reports count
- In Progress Reports count
- Average Compliance Score

### Report Table
- Report name and ID
- Framework with icon
- Status with color coding
- Compliance score with progress bar
- Report period dates
- Generation date and user
- Action buttons (view, download)

### Report Creation Dialog
- Report name input
- Framework selection dropdown
- Period start/end date pickers
- Optional description field
- Form validation

### Report Details Dialog
- Report summary information
- Compliance metrics visualization
- Detailed findings with accordion view
- Evidence and remediation details
- Download functionality

### Filtering & Search
- Framework filter dropdown
- Status filter dropdown
- Real-time filtering
- Loading indicators

## Integration Points

### Backend Integration
- Connects to Python API at `http://localhost:8000/api/compliance`
- Handles API errors gracefully
- Supports filtering and pagination

### Frontend Integration
- Integrated into main navigation (Sidebar.tsx)
- Follows application theming and design patterns
- Uses shared components (LoadingSpinner, etc.)

## Build Status
✅ **Successfully Built**: The feature compiles without errors
⚠️ **Minor Warnings**: Only ESLint warnings for unused imports (non-breaking)

## Next Steps for Full Functionality
1. **Backend Implementation**: Implement the compliance API endpoints in the Python backend
2. **Database Schema**: Create compliance-related database tables
3. **PDF Generation**: Implement report PDF generation functionality
4. **Authentication**: Add proper user authentication for report generation
5. **Real Data**: Connect to actual compliance data sources

## File Changes
- ✅ `frontend/src/pages/ComplianceReports.tsx` - Completely implemented
- ✅ Frontend build successful with new feature

The Compliance Reports feature is now fully implemented on the frontend and ready for backend integration.
